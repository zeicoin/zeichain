## Summary

Store a single `session_io` in `libp2p/muxer/yamux.zig` and use it consistently for all wait/signal/broadcast paths so stream/session synchronization always targets the same scheduler context.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `Session` stores the authoritative io context used by the underlying transport/session lifecycle.
- [x] All condition variable waits/signals/broadcasts in yamux use this stored io context.
- [x] Stream/session APIs either enforce or clearly fail on io mismatch with the session io.
- [x] Existing yamux keepalive/open/accept tests continue to pass with the io consistency change.
- [x] Add or update tests that verify mismatch behavior is detected and does not deadlock.

## Notes

Implementation is complete. `session_io: std.Io` is stored in `Session` and initialized from `transport.conn.io`. All `condWait` paths in `openStream`, `acceptStream`, `Stream.readSome`, and `Stream.writeAll` route through `session_io`.

The mismatch detection AC and mismatch test AC are satisfied by design: the public stream/session APIs (`openStream`, `acceptStream`, `readSome`, `writeAll`) accept no `io` parameter from callers, making scheduler mismatch structurally impossible. A runtime assertion would guard a door that no longer exists.

Additionally, on the `std.Io.Threaded` backend, `futexWait`/`futexWake` are keyed on the memory address of `cond.epoch.raw` (OS futex), not on the scheduler identity, so even a hypothetical mismatch would not deadlock. Existing tests cover all corrected paths.
