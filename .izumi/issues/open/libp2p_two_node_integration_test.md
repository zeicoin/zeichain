## Summary

Run `libp2p_testnode` on two separate hosts to validate the full libp2p stack — TCP dial/accept, Noise XX handshake, Yamux multiplexing, multistream negotiation, identify, and peer exchange — across a real network connection. The in-process and loopback tests cover correctness and throughput but cannot catch issues that only appear across real network links (MTU, latency, connection drops, NAT).

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Node A (listener) starts successfully and prints its listening multiaddr
- [ ] Node B (dialer) connects to Node A and completes the Noise XX handshake
- [ ] Both nodes complete `/ipfs/id/1.0.0` identify exchange and log each other's peer IDs
- [ ] Both nodes complete `/zeicoin/peers/1.0.0` peer exchange and update their address books
- [ ] Status loop on both nodes shows `known_peers >= 1` and `score > 0` after first successful dial
- [ ] Node B redial loop re-connects after a deliberate Node A restart
- [ ] Test passes over at least one real network link (LAN or remote/VPS)

## Notes

### Running the test

Build on both machines:
```bash
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseFast
```

Node A (bootstrap listener):
```bash
./zig-out/bin/libp2p_testnode /ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/10811
# prints: libp2p_testnode listening on /ip4/<ip>/tcp/10811
```

Node B (dialer):
```bash
./zig-out/bin/libp2p_testnode /ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/10812 /ip4/<node-a-ip>/tcp/10811
```

For two local terminals (same machine):
```bash
# Terminal 1
./zig-out/bin/libp2p_testnode /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/10811

# Terminal 2
./zig-out/bin/libp2p_testnode /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/10812 /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/10811
```

### What to observe

Both nodes should print every 5 seconds:
```
status: listening=... active_listeners=1 known_peers=1
  peer /ip4/.../tcp/... peer_id=<id> score=1 fails=0 ...
```
