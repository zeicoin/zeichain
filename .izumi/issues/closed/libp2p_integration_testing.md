## Summary

Verify the full libp2p integration end-to-end using the unit test suite and the Docker multi-node harness. Organic peer discovery must be observable in the harness before this story is considered done.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `zig build test-libp2p` passes cleanly (zero failures)
- [x] Docker harness (`./scripts/test_libp2p_docker.sh`) starts 4 nodes
- [x] Nodes discover each other organically via peer exchange
- [x] No memory leaks under `std.testing.allocator` in libp2p tests

## Notes

Verified on 2026-03-21 with:

- `zig build test-libp2p`
- Docker 4-node discovery harness
- 30-minute churned soak over the isolated `libp2p_testnode` topology

Remaining unchecked work is block propagation across real `zen_server` integration, which stays blocked on ZEI-33.
