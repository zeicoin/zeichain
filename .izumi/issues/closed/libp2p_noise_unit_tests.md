## Summary

Add unit tests for `security/noise.zig` covering the XX handshake, symmetric crypto round-trips, peer identity enforcement, and nonce exhaustion guards.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Test: initiator + responder complete XX handshake in-process (pipe)
- [x] Test: encrypted write on one side is correctly decrypted on the other
- [x] Test: connection from unexpected PeerId is rejected during handshake
- [x] Test: nonce overflow / reuse is caught
- [x] All tests use `std.testing.allocator`

## Notes

Implemented in `libp2p/security/noise.zig`:

- `noise concurrent handshake helpers`
- `symmetricstate encrypt/decrypt roundtrip`
- `noise wrong peer id is rejected during handshake`
- `noise cipher nonce exhaustion is rejected`

Verified as part of `zig build test-libp2p`.
